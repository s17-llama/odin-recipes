Building a basic recipe website

Following lesson 22 of The Odin Project, I am learning to create my first website.

I hold no copyright to the information presented in the recipe pages of this public repository. All pages and information have been pulled from Allrecipes.com in order for me test my ability to create a html page according to the instructions provided by The Odin Project.
